        I am currently pursuing my passion in computer programming at University of Washington to build dynamic end-to-end
        web applications and become a full stack web developer. I am very happy to attend this school and I am learning a lot of interesting things about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JS libraries, back end technologies like Node.js, relational and non-relational databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I cannot wait to show more of my projects in the comming months. <br>
        Thank you for visiting my page. Stay tuned.
